Tasks
=====

Task 1
------

In this section we made a function
$task1(steps,start,leftprob,stopprob)$. The function takes steps using
an algorithm that makes use of an algorithm that can be explained using
the following diagram.

Let us assume

-   The red region is the probability of not moving

-   The green region is the probability of moving left

-   The blue region is the probability of moving right

The algorithm simply checks if the randomly generated numbers
$0\leq n \leq 1$ lies within a certain region and makes movement
accordingly.\
\
Running the algorithm on multiple steps the following graphs were
obtained. To find the expected average distance at a certain step the we
ran multiple simulations of the code and calculated an average step at
each step. This rendered the following random walk that is made up of
average steps. This is then an expected random walk.

Task 2
------

In task 2 we took a similar approach as task 1. The only difference was
that we simulated a random walk for two particles on the same graph.
However, the same issues of randomness arose and it was impossible to
predict the average step at which the two particles met.\
\
Similar, to task 1 we simulated multiple random walks of the two
particles and calculated the average step at which the particles were
meeting for a certain number of steps and distance. The data of each
intercepting step was recorded into an array and the average was
calculated to find an expected intercepting step.\
\
We also plotted the average random walks of the the two particles and
the result of that was as follows: It is worth noting, however, that
this graph is also subject to change based on different parameters.
However, it seems to be stable on multiple executions. There is some
deviation though.

Task 3
------

In order to determine the step size and the orientation, we assumed that
the step size is a discreet random variable between 0, 0.5, 1 and
orientation is a discreet random variable between 0, $\frac{\pi}{2}$,
$\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, $2\pi$. We have used directional words such as
right referring to orientation of 0 as well as $2\pi$ and up referring
to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, etc.\
\
We have used an algorithm similar to those used in the previous tasks to
determine the probability of a step size and orientation being used. In
the case of the particle exceeding the 100 <math>unit^{2}</math> region, the
particle just reverses the direction that it was moving and bounces back
into the region. The trajectory is then plotted on a 3 dimensional
plane.This can be seen in the following graph where the region is being exceeded and a curved outline can be seen, showcasing the polar movement of the particle.

Task 4
------

For this section we have repeated a similar procedure to that used in
Task 1 except that in this case the step size is a continuous random
variable between 0-1 determined by the built-in **randi** function that
chooses a a number within the range with a uniform probability
distribution.

Task 5
------

This section is done in a similar manner to that of Task 3, however in
this case both the step size and orientation are continuous random
variables between 0-1 and 0-2$\pi$ respectively. The variables were
chosen in a similar manner to those in Task 4 by employing the **randi**
function.

Task 7
------

In this task we have used a similar algorithm to that in Task 3 with the
only exception that the orientation is a continuous random variable
between 0-2$\pi$ which is chosen in a similar manner to that in Task 4
by employing the **randi** function.

Task 8
------

Task 8 had many similar attributes to the task 2. Therefore, we used a similar approach to solve this problem. Using the random walk algorithm in task 5, we generated the random walk data
of two particles and stored the data in a 3 dimensional array. Where we stored the **(x,y)** coordinates at each step of each particle. This allowed us to run a simulation to find an average step at which the euclidean distance of the two particles was $\leq 1$. Then we further ran a simulation to find multiple expected aforementioned steps. This allowed us to model a distribution of the means. This produced a trend the show cased the mean variance in the means of the step at which the two particles have distance of 1 unit or less. This can be visualized in the following graph
