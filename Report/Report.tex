\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Task 1}
In this task we took a few assumptions to model the 1 dimensional random walk. Since there 
were only 3 possible movements: right, left, or no movement. We chose to model the walk using a 
uniform distribution. This was done by generating an array of random integers from the set $\{1,2,3\}$, similar to 
throwing a 3 sided die.
\begin{itemize}
    \item On 1, the particle moved right 1 unit
    \item On 2, the particle moved left 1 unit
    \item On 3, the particle did not move
\end{itemize}
Upon running the code by varying the number of steps the particle takes the following graphs
were produced.
