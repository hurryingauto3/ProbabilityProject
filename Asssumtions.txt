Task 1 (1D Walk)
- Steps are a unit of time
Task 2 (2 People 1D Walk)
- Person A starts (0,0)
- Person B starts (x,0) (Positive Distance Away)
Task 3 
- If bounds reached, the same distance is moved in negative for x and y
- Orientation is discrete between 0, pi/2, 3pi/2, 2pi 
Task 4
- Plot (r, theta)?
Task 5 
- Plot (r, theta)?
- Out of bounds assumption
- Used random to model uniform distribution
Task 7
- Assumed that r \in \{0,0.5,1\}
- Plot (r, theta)?
- Out of bounds assumption
- Used random to model uniform distribution
Task 8


Use distributions (Binomial, Normal, Exponential, uniform)
